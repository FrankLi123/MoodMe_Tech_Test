# MoodMe_Tech_Test


This project is a Tech task project for MoodeMe Company. It includes REST APIs that get data of restaurants from dataset provided. I used node.js for back-end service and MongoDB for databases, AWS EC2 for deloyment, angular and typescript for front-end.

**Map of the Project:**

Front-end page in Angular framework

 located at :
 ./angular/test/app/


Back-end APIs in Node.js 

MongoDB model located at:  
./models/model.js

Routes located at 
./routes/routes.js

Main page:
./index.js
 
 
 
**Database: **

MongoDB
 
In order to make the searching process more convenient and faster, I made one text index that supports searching for “type”, and a compound index that supports searching for Name.


**Deployment:**

AWS EC2
